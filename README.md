# SwissKnife 🧰

Wireless "swiss knife" that bundles multiple workflows into one menu-driven tool.
The main entry point is `swiss_knife.py`. Control the chaos with
[Lab5](https://github.com/C5Lab) (responsibly).

## Functions ✨

- Recon - passive discovery of nearby APs/clients
- Deauth - network deauthentication workflow
- Portal - phishing-style portal with logging
- Evil Twin - rogue AP + portal workflow
- ~~Handshaker - PCAP capture~~ (🚧 under construction 🚧)
- ~~Karma - rogue AP auto-responder~~ (🚧 under construction 🚧)

## Quick start ⚡

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D3h420/SwissKnife
cd SwissKnife
sudo chmod +x swiss_knife.py
python3 swiss_knife.py
```

Run as root (required for wireless operations). The menu lets you choose which
attack to run and guides you through the steps.

## Logs and captures 🧾

Captive Portal and Evil Twin store captured submissions in `log/` (created on
first run). Filenames are based on the selected SSID.

## HTML customization 🎨

The portal page is plain HTML and easy to edit in `html/portal.html`. Everything
under `html/` is safe to modify for UI tweaks or branding.

- Python 3
- Linux with a wireless adapter that supports monitor mode
- Root privileges
